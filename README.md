# Week 1: Musical Datasets

## Task 1: Dataset theme 

The theme of my dataset is music from the film La La Land starring Emma stone and Ryan Gosling. The film was premiered in 2016 and won six awards out of fourteen nominations at the 2017 academy awards; the song City of Stars from the film won best original song that year. La La land is one of my favourite films and I have seen it may times. I have played musical material from the film in various performance ensembles such as wind bands and orchestras and I have listened to the film soundtrack independently on many occasions. I believe that my familiarity and enjoyment of the music from La La Land will help me complete these tasks and my research a great deal more successfully and effectively.
