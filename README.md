# Jenny's project!

## week 1

picking a theme for the data set is difficult. i think i want to go in the direction of Astor Piazolla - i am really interested in his music and i certainly think theres enough data to research and accumilate it together. i think its interesting how versatile his music is, how it can so easily be played on so many different instruments and in diferent styles. from double bass concertos and orchestral symphony like pieces lie libertango and kicho to classic intimate guitar tango like cafe 1930. i really hoe i dont get sick of him cos i really like him, but i also think it would be really great to have the oppertunity to put all of his stuff in the same place so its easier to access. a challenge of using him as my dataset theme is that a lot of his work is very spreadout throughout time and his muic was ften reimagined in many different ways by many different people. he has a very wide repetoire of pieces and reimaginations, and instrumental artrists
