# Jenny's project!

## week 1

I am interested in taking my project theme in the direction of iconic music from high school movies. i have always loved cheesy high shcool movies, theres nothing better than cuddling up on the couch with a tub of ben and jerrys and watchig mean girls. i think some challanges of this on the curation side will be formatting the music, and another may be that i will have to decide what the term iconic includes. i think itll be a really good project and i will aim to present it in the style of a blog that i would genuinely read.
